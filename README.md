● The description of robot and code architecture is explained in “ User
Manual “ . 
● Open “ Game.hpp “ as described in “ User Manual “ . 
● Three roles are presented as I) Attacker , II) Defender and III)
Goalkeeper . 
● The working of these roles would be coded in their respective
function definition.
● Ex. : Open “ Attacker.hpp “ and you have to code inside “ attacker(state , botID )“ function. Same goes for other two roles. ● Main aim is to code in these three above mentioned files for
respective roles. 
● You can make your own skills or roles , the process is described in
“User Manual“. 
● The code requires state parameters and predicates , which has been
discussed in “User Manual“.
● Follow “Running Simulator“ part from “User Manual“ or “Setting up
the project“. 
● Go to Simurosot folder , open &quot;Run.bat&quot; in text editor (ex. Notepad++)
